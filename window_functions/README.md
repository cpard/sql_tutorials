This repo contains a small sample of JSON records following the RudderStack event spec that can be used 
to run the examples in the [Working with SQL Window Functions](https://www.cpard.xyz/posts/sql_window_functions_tutorial/) tutorial.

It contains 10,000 records in total.

If you'd like to experiment with more data or play around with different datasets, take a look at the
[Event Generator](https://github.com/cpard/events) that I used to generate the initial dataset.
